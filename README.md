# SDP-Quantum-OR
This repository contains commented Jupyter Notebooks and Python files that accompany
a paper titled ``Five Starter Pieces: Quantum Information Science via Semi-definite
Programs``, [arXiv:2112.08276](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08276)
by Vikesh Siddhu and Sridhar Tayur. These files are briefly
described below.


----------
Jupyter Notebooks
----------
The Jupyter Notebooks and supporting Python function files can be reviewed
using standard Jupyter Notebook and word processing software, respectively. In
addition to [PICOS](https://picos-api.gitlab.io/picos/index.html) and
[CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/), the notebooks use standard Python packages (for
instance see requirements.txt) and rely on supporting Python function files.
A description of each file is available within the file.
